About Satellite
---------------
Satellite is CORBA support for PHP using ORBit.

The original version was made by David Eriksson <david@2good.com> 
during the summer 2000.


Installation
------------
Read below about installing ORBit.

Then create a directory on your server for your IDL files, and add
an entry to your php.ini like this:

  idl_directory = /var/idl

Note: If you compile Satellite as a dynamic PHP extension you must have the
      above line located before the extension=satellite.so line in php.ini!

PHP as an Apache static module
------------------------------
Before linking Apache you must do either of these things:

  a) Before running Apache's configure you set the environment variable
     LIBS like this:

     export LIBS="`orbit-config --libs client` `libIDL-config --libs`"

  b) You edit apache/src/modules/php4/libphp4.module and
     add `orbit-config --libs client` `libIDL-config --libs`
     within the quotes on the line beginning with LIBS=


What version of ORBit is required?
----------------------------------
You need a CVS version of ORBit to use Satellite!

This does NOT work with ORBit 0.5.5 or earlier.

The latest CVS version of ORBit in CVS requires glib-2.0 and has not been 
tested. Because of this we checkout a CVS version from a known safe date.

(1) Get it from CVS

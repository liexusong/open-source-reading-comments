WHAT IS PEAR?

PEAR is a code repository for PHP extensions and PHP library code
similar to TeX's CTAN and Perl's CPAN.

The intention behind PEAR is to provide a means for library code
authors to organize their code in a defined way shared by other
developers, and to give the PHP community a single source for such
code.


ADMINISTRATION

This section will describe the rules for how files are structured and
how functions and classes should be named.


TOOLS

This section will describe the tools provided to PEAR users.


CODING RULES AND GUIDELINES

* All PHP code must use <?php ?>.  This is the only really portable tag.

* Before adding a new top-level directory ("DB" is one), discuss your
  intentions on php-pear@lists.php.net.

* Please see the CODING_STANDARDS file for full rules and guidelines.

WARNING

  This code is experimental! No docs, no support but discussion 
  on the pear list!
  
What's this?  

  If you're working on new PEAR contributions and your code is 
  finished for _90%_ or you plan to finish it _within a month_
  you may check it in to this directory. This allows you to continue 
  your work using the PEAR infrastructure: CVS, mailinglist (discussion).
  As soon as the code is on production level remove it from this
  directory.
  
  Always remember: Your code ships with every PHP 4 distribution so
  don't put it here for ages.
  
Directory structure

  Please use a directory structure like in the main PEAR directory. 
  If you have a new menu class, put it in Experimental/Html/.

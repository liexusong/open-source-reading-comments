Extensions
----------
MySQL, ODBC, FTP, Calendar, BCMath, COM, PCRE, Session, WDDX and XML support is *built-in*.
You don't need to load any additional extensions in order to use these functions.


Folders
-------
- mibs
The mibs directory contains support files for SNMP.
This directory should be moved to DRIVE:\usr\mibs (DRIVE being the drive where PHP is installed.)

- dlls
Some DLLs that are required for PHP and some extensions. Please copy them to your to your windows/system (Win9.x)
or winnt/system32 (WinNT, Win2000) directory.
If you already have these DLLs installed on your system, overwrite them only if something is not working correctly.
Before overwriting them, it is a good idea to back them or move them to another folder - just in case something goes wrong.


Installtion instructions
------------------------

Apache:
1. Stop the Apache Webserver.
Edit the httpd.conf and put in these lines, modified to your environment:

# for the apache module
LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php4

#for the cgi binary (you can use that one compiled with force cgi redirect too)
ScriptAlias /php4/ "C:/php/"
Action application/x-httpd-php4 "/php4/php.exe"
AddType application/x-httpd-php4 .php

2. Unzip the Package to c:\php, now move php4ts.dll to the windows/system(32) directory, overwritte any older file!

3. Copy the php.ini-dist to your sysroot (directory where you installed windows), rename it to php.ini, and
edit the php.ini to fit your needs.

4. Restart the Apache server.

Xitami:
1. Copy the php.ini-dist to your Systemroot (Directory where you installed windows), rename it to php.ini, and
edit it to fit your needs.
2. Make sure the webserver is running, and point your browser to xitamis admin console (usually http://127.0.0.1/admin), and click on Configuration
3. Now navigate to the Filters, and put the extension which php should parse (i.e. .php) into the field File extensions (.xxx)

edit it to fit your needs
2. Start the Microsoft Management Console or the Internet Services Manager, located in your Control Panel
3. Click on your webserver, and select properties
4. If you don't want to perform HTTP Authentication using PHP, you can (and should) skip this step. Under ISAPI Filters,
add a new ISAPI filter. Use PHP as the filter name, and supply a path to the php4isapi.dll
5. Under Home Directory, click on the Configuration button. Add a new entry to the Application Mappings. Use the path the
php4isapi.dll as the Executable, supply .php as the extension, leave Method exclusions, blank, and check the Script engine
checkbox
6. Stop IIS completely

edit it to fit your needs
2. Start the Microsoft Management Console (may appear as 'Internet Services Manager', either in your Windows NT 4.0
Option Pack branch or the Control Panel->Administrative Tools under Windows 2000).
3. Right click on your Web server node (will most probably appear as 'Default Web Server'), and select 'Properties'.
4. Under 'Home Directory', click on the 'Configuration' button. Add a new
5. entry to the Application Mappings; Use the path to php.exe as the Executable, supply .php as the extension, leave

PWS 4.0+ (isapi):
1. Copy the php.ini-dist to your systemroot (the directory where you installed windows), rename it to php.ini, and
edit it to fit your needs
2. Edit the enclosed PWS-php4isapi.reg (ISAPI interface) or PWS-php4cgi.reg (CGI interface) file to reflect the location of
your php4isapi.dll / php.exe. Forward slashes should be escaped, for example:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w3svc\parameters\Script Map] ".php"="C:\\Program Files\\PHP\\php4isapi.dll"
3. In the PWS Manager, right click on a given directory you want to add PHP support to, and select Properties. Check the 'Execute' checkbox, and confirm. 


PWS 4.0+ (CGI):
1. Copy the php.ini-dist to your systemroot (the directory where you installed windows), rename it to php.ini, and
edit it to fit your needs
2. Edit the enclosed PWS-php4.reg file to reflect the location of your php.exe. Forward slashes should be escaped,
for example:

3. In the PWS Manager, right click on a given directory you want to add PHP
support to, and select Properties. Check the 'Execute' checkbox, and
confirm.
4. At this point, PWS should have built-in PHP support.

NETSCAPE SERVERS, PHP as CGI (for Netscape Enterprise Server, iPlanet, perhaps Fastrack..) 
1. Copy the php.ini-dist to your systemroot (the directory where you installed windows), and edit it to fit your needs
2. Copy php4ts.dll to your systemroot (the directory where you installed windows) 
3. Make a file assocition from the command line (type the 2 following lines)
      assoc .php=PHPScript
      ftype PHPScript=d:\php4\php.exe %1 %*
4. In the Netscape Enterprise Administration Server create a dummy shellcgi directory and remove it just after
      (this step creates 5 important lines in obj.conf and allow the web server to handle shellcgi scripts)
5. In the Netscape Enterprise Administration Server create a new mime type
      (Category:type,Content-Type:magnus-internal/shellcgi,File Suffix:php)
6. Do it for each web server instance you want php to run
